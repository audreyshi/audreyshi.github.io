Mindy Kaling is a comedian, former writer on _The Office_, and director of "The Mindy Show." She's one of my favorite celebrities. What's more, last summer, I read her book (_Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?_) and learned that she is also one of my favorite writers. Check out her [blog](http://mindyephron.blogspot.com) for evidence. I don't know how she manages to be funny, relatable, and able to make a good point at the same time. (Writing is hard!)

However, I do not agree with [this post](http://mindyephron.blogspot.com/2008/03/sour-candies.html)! Unlike Mindy's claim, I know for a fact (okay not for a fact, but I have done similar things before) that I am (woefully) perfectly capable of eating three of those "Big Daddy" Jacques Torres chocolate bars in one sitting -- the only difference between eating three chocolate bars and three bags of sour gummies is that sour gummies don't make you feel like you just gained seven pounds. It's not like after eating a ton of sour gummies, you can imagine all the cocoa butter and fat and cholesterol and sugar slowly metabolizing into adipose tissue in your system. It is much easier to rationalize gummies, which as far as I am concerned contain sourness plus mysterious gelatinous stuff. (It's like the comforting feeling of using a credit card instead of physical cash.)

Bringing up Mindy, however, was not meant to be a segway into a blog about the benefits of chocolate vs. gummies, but into a blog post about some of my favorite things, since her blog is incidentally titled, "Things I've Bought That I Love." (It also works because Mindy is one of my "favorite" celebrities -- see what I did there?)

Some favorites:

1. This [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPbrlNsMTg4) about Starbucks misspellings. This is particularly applicable to me because no one ever gets my name right (plus whenever I happen upon a shop with those customized name keychains, my name is NEVER on a keychain. This means that whenever my name _does_ appear on a keychain, I get super excited about a keychain, which is silly). In the past summer, I have gotten the following written on my Starbucks cups: "Andrese" "Adu" "Odrie" "Audrn" and "Jan.""

2. I'm not a huge anime fan, but I do like [Neon Genesis Evangelion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nQNSLB3Lpk) a lot.

3. I love [TED talks](http://www.ted.com/talks) -- never has it been easier to find instant inspiration and perspective-changing advice from the Internet.

4. Working in coffee shops. This summer, I was in Cambridge/Boston, so [this](http://www.1369coffeehouse.com/) was my home for a lot of the time. I also like Boston a lot, although it can't compare to New York City obviously!

5. [West Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Lake) (Xi Hu) in Hangzhou, China. Definitely one of the most [gorgeous](http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/photo-day-west-lake-dusk) places I've visited.

Also, this doesn't exactly belong here, but I wanted to show you the inspiration behind my learning how to use GitHub and deciphering what CoffeeScript and Ruby and Jekyll are, which is this [beautifully-designed website](http://aprilzero.com). For some reason, I never really thought about design and website-building as seriously being compatible tasks before, but reading through ["The Making of Aprilzero"](http://aprilzero.com/journal/making-of-aprilzero/) showed me just how much thought and deliberate effort can go into it. I forked this website design from [Mu-An Chiou](http://muan.co/), but hopefully I'll be working on improving/building upon it to make it more personal! I also very much have to start [developing locally](http://daraskolnick.com/developer-tip-tuesday-always-develop-locally/) instead of real-time committing to the web so much!!
