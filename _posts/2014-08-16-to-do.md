Hi there! This is my **to-do list** for this website. <3

1.	Make the title into a link to the home page
2.	Edit the placeholder posts
3.	Include icons for my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Email (possibly also Goodreads)
4.	Include links to About, Resume, Email, GitHub (Make into icons on the navbar, or above the navbar?)
5.	Set up Disqus
6.	Update user picture to have a transparent background
7.	Learn how to use Bootstrap, Inskape
~~8.	Custom domain name: http://audreyshi.co~~ Hooray! Finally got this working.
9.	Make it so that links color when hovered over
10.	Make user photo larger, make title larger
11.	Tags! Instead of links. Projects, Travel, Favorites
12.	Make everything darken when hover over user photo

I'm using the 'Scribble' theme by Mu-An Chiou:

> There is no clever design philosophy to talk about, I tried to find something to work with, and 'scribble' came to my mind. This theme uses Open Sans powered by Google Web Fonts, and was written in plain HTML, SCSS & CoffeeScript, though .scss & .coffee files wouldn't be included in the theme. 
>
> The theme is mobile optimised but I did not check browser compatibility.It looks great in Chrome, Safari and Firefox though.

### Get started

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/muan/scribble/fork).
2. Clone the repository to your computer.<br /> `git clone https://github.com/username/scribble`
3. `bundle install`
4. **If using older versions of Jekyll**<br />
  Build and run jekyll using `jekyll --server --auto`.<br />
  **If using [Jekyll 1.0](http://blog.parkermoore.de/2013/05/06/jekyll-1-dot-0-released/)**<br />
  Build Jekyll using `jekyll build`.<br />
  Then run Jekyll using `jekyll serve --watch`<br />
5. Go to http://localhost:4000 for your site.

### Make it yours

1. I have extract most user specific information to `_config.yml`, you should be able to set up almost everything from it.
2. Change about.md for blog intro.
3. For domain settings, see [the guide from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).

### Options

When writing a post, there are 3 options you can add to the header.

1. **disqus: y**<br />
  If disqus is set to 'y', at the end of the post there will be a disqus thread, just like this one. To use disqus, you MUST [set up your own disqus account](http://disqus.com/).

2. **share: y**<br />
  An option for showing tweet and like button under a post.

3. **date**: 2013-05-06 18:07:17<br />
  Date is not a required header since Jekyll reads the file name for date, this was added in only for the **signoff time**. (as shown at the end of this post) If you don't want the signoff time, go into `/includes/signoff.html` and remove the `<span>`.
