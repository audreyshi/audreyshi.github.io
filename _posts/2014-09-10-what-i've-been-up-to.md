Thanks to [this post](https://medium.com/@LovettLovett/github-pages-godaddy-f0318c2f25a), I finally linked my github page to this custom domain!

Other than that, here's a list of some things I've been up to:
- **Origami**: Origami make really cute gifts! Recently, I made this [armadillo](http://www.origami-resource-center.com/images/dollarArmadillo.jpg) for a friend. I also tried to make a [camera](http://www.origami-guide.com/origami-money-camera.html), but it ended up all lopsided and flimsy... now I just have a very crumpled dollar bill that isn't going to make it through vending machines anytime soon (I'll try again later!).
- I've been working on a **bioinformatics research project** lately which has been super exciting! I've learned a lot about [genome wide association studies (GWAS)](http://www.genome.gov/20019523). Gnenome wide association studies are used to survey the associations between SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and disease incidence, allowing researchers to interrogate genetic links to disease. This is complicated by the large presence of roughly [10 million SNPs](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/genomicresearch/snp) in the human genome, meaning it is difficult to create a study with enough statistical power to identify significant SNPs. There are also lots of cool machine learning applications in bioinformatics (e.g. natural language processing).
- Been trying to re-learn piano (currently learning Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat Major, Op. 9 No. 2).
- This is a neat [machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml), although I haven't completed it yet.
- Tip if you're trying to learn a language: text/e-mail in that language with a friend! I've been doing this in French with a friend who's trying to learn it.
- [This](http://mashable.com/2013/07/11/lorem-ipsum/) is hilarious! If you're not satisfied with boring Latin filler on your website...
